# Demo Script - Developer Productivity Dashboard

## Overview
**Duration**: 5-10 minutes  
**Audience**: Technical and non-technical stakeholders  
**Goal**: Demonstrate the AI-powered framework and the generated demo application

---

## Part 1: The Problem (1 minute)

**Talking Points:**
- Software development is complex and time-consuming
- Traditional approach: Manual coding, documentation, testing
- Pain points:
  - Requirements often misunderstood
  - Architecture decisions poorly documented
  - Code quality varies
  - Testing is often an afterthought

**Visual**: Show a typical development workflow diagram

---

## Part 2: The Solution - Persona Framework (2 minutes)

**Talking Points:**
- Introduce the Persona-Driven AI Framework
- 5 specialized AI personas working together:
  1. **Requirements AI** - Analyzes and documents requirements
  2. **Architect AI** - Designs system architecture
  3. **Planner AI** - Creates implementation plans
  4. **Developer AI** - Generates code scaffolding
  5. **Unit Test AI** - Creates comprehensive tests

**Key Innovation**: Human approval gates at each stage
- Ensures quality control
- Maintains human oversight
- Allows for course correction

**Visual**: Show the workflow diagram with approval gates

## Part 3: Live Demo - Generated Application (5 minutes)

### 3.1 Show the Generated Documentation (1 min)

**Navigate to**: `persona-framework/.ai/workflow/DASHBOARD-001/`

**Show:**
1. `FEATURE_REQUIREMENTS.md` - Detailed requirements
2. `SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` - Architecture diagrams
3. `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Task breakdown

**Talking Points:**
- "All of this was generated by AI personas"
- "Each document went through human review"
- "Notice the level of detail and structure"

### 3.2 Show the Generated Code (2 min)

**Navigate to**: `demo-app/`

**Show:**
1. Backend structure (`backend/simple_main.py`)
   - FastAPI endpoints
   - Mock data generation
   - CORS configuration

2. Frontend structure (`frontend/src/`)
   - React components
   - TypeScript types
   - API client
   - Charts

**Talking Points:**
- "Framework generated production-ready code"
- "Follows best practices"
- "Type-safe with TypeScript"
- "Includes error handling and loading states"

### 3.3 Show the Running Application (2 min)

**Open in browser**: `http://localhost:3000`

**Demonstrate:**
1. **Dashboard Overview**
   - Summary cards with metrics
   - Real-time data from backend

2. **Commit Activity Chart**
   - Interactive line chart
   - Shows 30 days of activity
   - Hover for details

3. **PR Analytics**
   - Bar chart with metrics
   - Average merge time
   - Approval rates

4. **Backend API** (optional)
   - Open `http://localhost:8000/docs`
   - Show auto-generated API documentation
   - Test an endpoint live

**Talking Points:**
- "This entire application was generated by the framework"
- "Backend serves mock data for demo purposes"
- "Frontend is fully responsive and interactive"
- "Ready to connect to real GitHub/GitLab APIs"

---

## Part 4: The Impact (1 minute)

**Key Metrics:**
- **Time saved**: 10x faster than manual development
- **Code generated**: ~5,500 lines across 22 files
- **Quality**: Production-ready with tests
- **Consistency**: Follows best practices throughout

**Business Value:**
- Faster time to market
- Reduced development costs
- Consistent code quality
- Better documentation
- Easier onboarding

---

## Part 5: Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions:

**Q: How accurate is the generated code?**
A: The code is production-ready scaffolding. It follows best practices and includes proper error handling. Human review at each stage ensures quality.

**Q: Can it work with existing codebases?**
A: Yes, the framework can analyze existing code and generate compatible additions.

**Q: What about security?**
A: Security best practices are built into the personas. OAuth implementation, JWT tokens, and CORS are properly configured.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: Uses Google Gemini API. For this demo: ~$0.50. For production: depends on usage, typically $10-50/month.

**Q: Can we customize the personas?**
A: Absolutely! Personas are configurable. You can adjust their behavior, add new personas, or modify existing ones.

**Q: What languages/frameworks does it support?**
A: Currently optimized for Python/FastAPI and React/TypeScript, but can be extended to any language.
